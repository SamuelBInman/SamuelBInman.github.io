I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) at Sandia National Laboratories, where I track creep in additively manufactured metals. My work focuses on high-throughput, multimodal data collection to monitor degradation throughout the lifetime of structural and electrochemical materials, providing both surveillance and predictive insight. While my team applies machine learning tools, my focus is on designing experiments and interpreting the fundamental science behind material aging. During my graduate work at the University of Virginia under John R. Scully (2019), I investigated the passivity and corrosion behavior of multi-phase alloys, linking microstructure to corrosion resistance. I aim to tie corrosion studies into a broader approach to material aging, enabling a comprehensive assessment of lifetimes across multiple material classes. Looking forward, I aim to build a research program that leverages these tools to study the environmental degradation of structural and energy materials, while fostering the growth and development of those I work with both within and beyond the aging & lifetime community
